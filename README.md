ObluScope is a Java based R&D tool for oblu, which allows data logging and analysis. It is useful for STEM experiments. ObluScope acquires and plots real-time motion data, i.e. 3-axis acceleration and 3-axis angular rotation speed, from oblu via USB. It also saves acquired data in logfile.

Following dependencies are used in implementation::
 - RXTX jar and native library from http://fizzed.com/oss/rxtx-for-java 
 - JOGL jar from https://jogamp.org/wiki/index.php/Downloading_and_installing_JOGL

RXTX - a Java cross platform wrapper library for the serial port

JOGL - Java OpenGL (JOGL) is a wrapper library that allows OpenGL to be used in the Java programming language.
