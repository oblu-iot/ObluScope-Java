ObluScope - Java
===================================

Animating 3D Rotatory Motion

ObluScope is an Java based R&D tool for oblu, which allows data logging and analysis. It is useful for STEM experiments. ObluScope receives and plots motion data, i.e. 3-axis acceleration and 3-axis angular rotation speed, in real-time from oblu via USB. It also saves data in logfile.
